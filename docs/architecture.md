# Tool Registry Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Tool Registry system architecture, describing its main components, data flow, and design principles.

## System Overview

The Tool Registry is designed as a centralized management system for AI tools and services. It provides a secure and controlled way to register, access, and monitor the usage of AI-powered tools across an organization or platform.

## Core Components

### 1. API Layer

The API layer serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Tool Registry. It handles:

- RESTful API endpoints for tool management
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation
- Response formatting

The API is built using FastAPI, providing automatic schema validation, documentation generation, and high performance.

### 2. Core Services

#### Tool Registry Service

The central service that manages the tool catalog, providing:
- Tool registration and metadata management
- Tool discovery and search functionality
- Tool versioning and lifecycle management

#### Access Control Service

Manages who can access which tools and under what conditions:
- Policy definition and enforcement
- Access request processing
- Permission validation

#### Identity Service

Handles agent (user/system) identities:
- Agent registration and authentication
- Role management
- Credential issuance

#### Monitoring Service

Tracks tool usage and system health:
- Usage statistics collection
- Access logs
- Performance metrics

#### Rate Limiting Service

Controls the frequency of tool access:
- Rate limit definition per agent/policy
- Limit enforcement
- Quota management

### 3. Data Layer

The data layer persists all system information using a relational database (PostgreSQL by default):

#### Main Entities

- **Tools**: Tool definitions, endpoints, parameters, and metadata
- **Agents**: Users, services, or AI systems that access tools
- **Policies**: Rules governing tool access
- **Credentials**: Authentication credentials for tools
- **AccessLogs**: Records of tool usage

## Data Flow

### Tool Registration

1. An administrator or tool provider submits a tool registration request
2. The API validates the request
3. The Tool Registry Service processes the registration
4. The tool is stored in the database
5. A response with the tool ID is returned

### Tool Access

1. An agent requests access to a tool
2. The Authentication Service validates the agent's identity
3. The Access Control Service checks if the agent has permission to use the tool
4. The Rate Limiting Service ensures the agent hasn't exceeded limits
5. If approved, the system grants access and issues any necessary credentials
6. The access is logged
7. The tool credentials are returned to the agent

### Tool Search and Discovery

1. An agent submits a search query
2. The Tool Registry Service searches the tool catalog
3. The Access Control Service filters results based on the agent's permissions
4. Relevant tools are returned to the agent

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

The Tool Registry implements JWT-based authentication for API access. This provides:
- Stateless authentication
- Expiring tokens
- Claim-based identity

### Authorization

Authorization is policy-based, allowing fine-grained control over:
- Which agents can access which tools
- What operations agents can perform
- What parameters agents can use
- When and how frequently tools can be accessed

### Encryption

Sensitive data is protected through:
- TLS for all API communication
- Encrypted storage of credentials and secrets
- Key rotation policies

## Scalability and Performance

The Tool Registry is designed for scalability:

- Stateless API design allows horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations

## Integration Patterns

### External Tool Integration

Tools are integrated through:
- API endpoint definitions
- Authentication configuration
- Parameter schemas

### Identity Provider Integration

The system supports integration with external identity providers via:
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- SAML
- Custom identity adapters

### Monitoring and Analytics

Monitoring is available through:
- Prometheus metrics
- Structured logging
- Integration with observability platforms

## Database Schema

![Database Schema](./images/database_schema.png)

The main database tables and their relationships are:

- `agents`: Represents users or services that can access tools
- `tools`: Stores registered tools and their configurations
- `policies`: Contains access control rules
- `credentials`: Manages authentication credentials
- `access_logs`: Records tool usage history
- `tool_metadata`: Stores additional tool information

## Deployment Architecture

The Tool Registry supports various deployment options:

### Standalone Deployment

A single-instance deployment suitable for development or small-scale use:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Tool Registry    │
│                     │
│  ┌───────────────┐  │
│  │   API Layer   │  │
│  └───────────────┘  │
│  ┌───────────────┐  │

│  └───────────────┘  │
│  ┌───────────────┐  │
│  │  Database     │  │
│  └───────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Microservices Deployment

A distributed deployment for production use:
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│  API Gateway│  │ Tool Service│  │Access Service│
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
       │                │                │
       └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                        │
                ┌───────────────┐
                │   Database    │
                └───────────────┘
```

### Cloud Deployment

The system can be deployed on cloud platforms:
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Container instances
- Managed database services
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

## Future Architecture Considerations

- GraphQL API for more flexible querying
- Event-driven architecture for improved scalability
- Multi-region deployment for global availability
- AI-powered recommendations for tool discovery
- Blockchain integration for immutable audit trails
