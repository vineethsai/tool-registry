# Tool Registry Security Guide

> **WARNING: AUTHENTICATION DISABLED FOR DEVELOPMENT**  
> Authentication has been temporarily disabled to facilitate development and testing. Before deploying to production, authentication MUST be re-enabled by reverting the changes in `tool_registry/api/app.py` that replaced `get_current_agent` with `get_default_admin_agent`. See the Authentication Status section below for details.

This document outlines the security architecture, practices, and recommendations for deploying and using the Tool Registry system securely.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

The Tool Registry implements a multi-layered authentication system:

1. **JWT-based API Authentication**
   - All API requests require a valid JWT token
   - Tokens have limited lifetimes and include scope restrictions
   - Refresh tokens are rotated regularly

2. **Tool Authentication**
   - Secure storage of tool credentials
   - Support for multiple authentication methods (API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.)
   - Credential rotation and expiration management

3. **Agent Identity Management**
   - Strong identity verification for agents
   - Support for integration with enterprise identity providers
   - Role-based authorization

### Authorization Model

The Tool Registry implements a comprehensive policy-based access control system:

1. **Policy Framework**
   - Fine-grained access control policies
   - Support for complex conditions and rules
   - Policy inheritance and priority management

2. **Scopes**
   - Specific permissions for different operations (read, execute, admin)
   - Scope-based access control for API endpoints
   - Least privilege principle enforcement

3. **Context-Aware Access Control**
   - Time-based restrictions
   - Location-based restrictions
   - Rate-limiting and quota enforcement

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Credential Encryption**
   - All credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256
   - Key management using a secure key vault
   - Credentials are never exposed in logs or error messages

2. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Minimal collection of PII
   - Strong access controls for PII data
   - Compliance with data protection regulations

3. **Data Masking and Redaction**
   - Automatic redaction of sensitive data in logs
   - Masking of sensitive fields in API responses
   - Sanitization of request/response data in access logs

### Secure Communication

1. **Transport Layer Security**
   - TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Strong cipher suite configuration
   - Certificate validation and pinning

2. **API Security**
   - Input validation for all API endpoints
   - Protection against common API attacks
   - Rate limiting and throttling

## Deployment Security

### Secure Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive configuration via environment variables
   - Secret management integration
   - No hardcoded secrets in code or configuration files

2. **Database Security**
   - Encrypted connections to database
   - Strong authentication for database access
   - Regular backup and disaster recovery

3. **Container Security**
   - Minimal base images
   - Non-root user execution
   - Read-only file systems where possible

### Network Security

1. **Network Isolation**
   - Separate network segments for different components
   - Firewall rules limiting access
   - Network traffic encryption

2. **API Gateway**
   - DDoS protection
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - API request validation

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive audit logs for all operations
   - Tamper-evident logging
   - Log aggregation and analysis

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Behavioral analytics to detect unusual patterns
   - Alerting for suspicious activities
   - Integration with SIEM systems

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Regular automated vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability tracking
   - Security patching process

### Incident Response

1. **Response Plan**
   - Documented incident response procedures
   - Clear roles and responsibilities
   - Communication protocols

2. **Breach Handling**
   - Containment procedures
   - Forensic investigation process
   - Notification and disclosure protocols

## Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Access Control**
   - Implement the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review and audit access permissions
   - Implement admin access controls with MFA

2. **Deployment**

   - Implement proper error handling
   - Validate tool responses

### For Tool Providers

1. **Tool Registration**
   - Provide detailed parameter specifications
   - Document authentication requirements clearly

The security team will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and work to address the vulnerability promptly.

## Authentication Status

> **IMPORTANT WARNING: AUTHENTICATION IS DISABLED**  
> Authentication has been intentionally disabled in the current version to facilitate development and testing. This makes the API completely open and accessible without credentials, which presents significant security risks in production environments.

The Tool Registry system is designed with comprehensive authentication and authorization capabilities, but these have been temporarily disabled to allow for easier development and testing. In a production environment, these security features MUST be re-enabled.

### Current Authentication Implementation

In the current implementation:
- The function `get_current_agent` has been replaced with `get_default_admin_agent`
- All API endpoints use a default admin agent instead of requiring valid credentials
- JWT tokens are still generated but not validated for authentication
- The `/token` endpoint returns a test token without validating credentials

### How to Re-enable Authentication

Before deploying to production, authentication must be re-enabled:

1. Revert the changes in `tool_registry/api/app.py` that replaced `get_current_agent` with `get_default_admin_agent`
2. Restore proper token validation in the `/token` endpoint
3. Ensure all endpoints properly depend on the `get_current_agent` function:
   ```python
   @app.post("/tools/", response_model=ToolResponse)
   async def register_tool(
       tool_request: ToolCreateRequest, 
       current_agent: AgentResponse = Depends(get_current_agent)
   ):
       # Authorization checks
       # ...
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Development Environment

In the current configuration:

- **Authentication is completely disabled** for all API endpoints
- All requests use a default admin agent with full privileges
- Authorization checks within the API have been bypassed
- JWT tokens and API keys are still generated but are not validated
- The default admin agent is used for operations that would normally require admin privileges

### Production Security Recommendations

Before deploying to production, implement the following security measures:

1. **Re-enable Authentication**: Follow the instructions in the Authentication Status section to restore proper authentication

2. **Set Strong Secret Keys**: Configure strong, unique secret keys for JWT signing:
   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET_KEY")  # Must be set in environment
   ```

3. **Implement HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production with a valid SSL certificate.

4. **Database Security**: Use a secure database connection with strong credentials and limited access.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

6. **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are properly validated.

7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring.

## User Authentication Flow

Once authentication is re-enabled, the standard flow will be:

1. Register a user via `/register` endpoint
2. Authenticate via `/token` endpoint using username/password
3. Use the JWT token for all subsequent API calls
4. Optionally create API keys for programmatic access

## API Key Security

When using API keys in production:

- Store API keys securely
- Rotate keys periodically
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Restrict permissions to only what is needed
- Implement key revocation mechanisms

## Role-Based Access Control

The Tool Registry supports role-based access control:

- `admin`: Full access to all system functions
- `tool_publisher`: Ability to register and update tools
- `policy_admin`: Can manage access policies
- `user`: Basic access to tools with appropriate permissions
